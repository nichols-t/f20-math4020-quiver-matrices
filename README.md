# f20-math4020-quiver-matrices

This repository contains the report and code for my research project, which involves studying the eigenvalues of a particular matrix construction on quivers. 
For more details, see the report file, which is titled `main.pdf` (or `main.tex` if you really want to compile it yourself. But beware! you need the image files too).


# Code

The python file should have enough documentation to get you started. If you run into problems, most of the code is built around `matplotlib` plots and `numpy` matrices.

There are several functions that can be useful for translating a calculation into a LaTeX format.
