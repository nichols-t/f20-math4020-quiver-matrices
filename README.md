# f20-math4020-quiver-matrices

This repository contains the report and code for my research project, which involves studying the eigenvalues of a particular matrix construction on quivers. 
For more details, see the report file, which is titled `main.pdf` (or `main.tex` if you really want to compile it yourself. But beware! you need the image files too).
