# f20-math4020-quiver-matrices

This repository contains the report and code for my research project, which involves studying the eigenvalues of a particular matrix construction on quivers. For more details, see the report file (`main.pdf`).

# Code

The python file should have enough documentation to get you started. If you run into problems, most of the code is built around `matplotlib` plots and `numpy` matrices.

There are several functions that can be useful for translating a calculation into a LaTeX format.
